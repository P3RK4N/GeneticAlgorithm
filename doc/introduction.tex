    In this paper, we present a method for training a neural network to control the movement of a character in a custom physics simulation of walking using GLSL. Our approach utilizes an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the network's parameters, with the goal of achieving a realistic and efficient walking motion. The custom physics simulation is designed to be highly parallelizable, which allows for real-time interactive control of the character's movement. We also show how Pytorch was used as an experimentation tool before building the final implementation in GLSL.
